I'm a **Computer Engineering** student with a passion for programming, robotics and **cybersecurity!**

My workflow/setup consists of: 
- My desktop PC which I use for **VMs, gaming, and recording videos**. I dual boot w/ Arch + KDE and Windows 11 (windows SUCKS it keeps installing updates behind my back). 
    - Arch is for notetaking and occasional reverse engineering whilst Windows is for gaming. 
- My Thinkpad which is currently running Arch Linux w/ Hyprland! Dotfiles can be found [**here.**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/nubbsterr/tree/main/dotfiles)


My current activities are:
* Grinding **HTB** Academy/Labs a bunch
* Posting lab attempts and Limbus Company videos on my [**YT channel!**](https://www.youtube.com/@0xnubb)
* Working on my [**portfolio**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/web)
* Working on my [**port scanner**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/nubbscan) 

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
