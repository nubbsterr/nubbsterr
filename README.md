I'm a **Computer Engineering** student with a passion for programming, robotics and **cybersecurity!** 

My workflow/setup consists of: 
* My desktop PC which I use for **VMs, gaming, and recording videos**. I dual boot w/ Arch + Niri and Windows 11 (windows SUCKS it keeps installing updates behind my back). 
    * Arch is currently for notetaking and my daily driver, whilst Windows is for gaming.
    * may/may not try gentoo one day

Unrelated but I found a very sweet video on study techniques over [here by Zach Highley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChCj1axcIqc).

Just to summarize the tips I gained from this vid:
* Take time to always have fun + get sleep/exercise/eat/chill because being tired/out of shape/hungry/angry is not gonna help studying.
    * Try and chill before a test/exam to let your brain chill and forget about the hard stuff and let the info you've been studying sink in.
* Don't worry much about grades unless you enjoy the thing you're studying.
* Effort is not proportial to marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course studying is good, but following the above 2 tips take precedence.
    * Try and explain hard concepts to a friend/rubber ducky/anything (Feynman technique >>>>>>>>)
    * Be okay with not knowing things. You will figure things out in time.
    * Do NOT get hung up on feeling smart and thus thinking you'll blast through things. Life doesn't work like that. Particularly w/ uni, it's best to be ready for a challenge.
        * "Fixed intelligence mindset"
* Do NOT ever try memorizing anything. Always link back to understanding and create a chain of thought that you can refer to. Think of this as fault tolerance for your knowledge.
