## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nubb.

I'm a Grade 11 CS Student with a passion for programming and CS-related topics.

The bulk of my time is spent at school, but when I'm not there, I'm probably programming in Python creating something new to show the world! I've done a lot of stuff in Python over the past 6 months, between <strong>game development</strong>, <strong>GUIs</strong>, and even <strong>web development using Flask!</strong>

Currently, I'm working away at Python and plan to dive into <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> as that's a career path I want to pursue after high school :)

<strong>If you wanna reach out with me</strong>, you can do so through messaging me on Discord through my username: <strong>nubbieeee</strong>!
