I'm a **Grade 12 CS Student** with a passion for programming, robotics and cybersecurity!

The bulk of my time is spent at school, most of my time afterschool is spent working on **projects**, which you can always find on my **GitHub**! I am also doing some **homelab** setup which you can soon find on my GitHub, as well as a lot of Blue Team studying on HTB! 

My workflow consist of my desktop PC which I use for **VMs and recording videos**, and my laptop which I use for **note-taking** and other activities on-the-go. My PC runs Windows 11 and I run **Arch** (btw) on my laptop with [**chadwm**](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm) and [**siduck's st**](https://github.com/siduck/st).

My current activities are:
* Grinding **HTB** Academy/Labs a bunch
* Posting lab attempts on my [**YT**](https://www.youtube.com/@0xnubb)
* Working on my [**portfolio**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/web)
* Creating my own [**AV**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/Eurofighter) in Python

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
