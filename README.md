I'm a **Computer Engineering** student with a passion for programming, robotics and **cybersecurity!** 

My workflow/setup consists of: 
- My desktop PC which I use for **VMs, gaming, and recording videos**. I dual boot w/ Arch + Niri and Windows 11 (windows SUCKS it keeps installing updates behind my back). 
    - Arch is currently for notetaking and my daily driver, whilst Windows is for gaming. I plan to get some rev tools (Detect-it-easy and Binja) on here sometime so I can do some crackme stuff here and there (suck at RE tho atm but we'll get there). 

Dotfiles can be found [**here.**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/nubbsterr/tree/main/dotfiles)
