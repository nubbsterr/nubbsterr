I'm a (soon-to-be) **Computer Engineering** student with a passion for programming, robotics and **cybersecurity!**

My workflow/setup consists of: 
- My desktop PC which I use for **VMs, gaming, and recording videos**. 
- My TWO laptops which I use for **note-taking** and other activities on-the-go. 

My PC runs Windows 11 and I run OpenSUSE w/ i3 on my lovely **Thinkpad T450s**. Dotfiles can be found [**here.** folder](https://github.com/nubbsterr/nubbsterr/)

My current activities are:
* Grinding **HTB** Academy/Labs a bunch
* Posting lab attempts and Limbus Company videos on my [**YT**](https://www.youtube.com/@0xnubb)
* Working on my [**portfolio**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/web)
* Creating my own [**AV**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/Eurofighter) in Python
* Creating my own [**port scanner**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/sawyer) 

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
