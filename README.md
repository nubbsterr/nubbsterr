## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nubb.

I'm a Grade 12 CS Student with a passion for programming, robotics and cybersecurity!

The bulk of my time is spent at school, most of my time afterschool is spent (currently) studying for my Security+ exam! I am also doing some homelab setup which you can soon find on my GitHub, as well as a lot of Blue/Red Team studying for Active Directory particularly! 

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
