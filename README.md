I'm a **Grade 12 CS Student** with a passion for programming, robotics and cybersecurity!

The bulk of my time is spent at school, most of my time afterschool is spent working on many of my **projects**, which you can always find on my **GitHub**! I spend a lot of time on HTB Academy as well, and plan to continue my studies over the summer. I am also doing some **homelab** setup between hosting my own [SIEM solution](https://github.com/nubbsterr/Elastic-SIEM-Setup) and [AD environment](https://github.com/nubbsterr/lcb-ad). 

My workflow/setup consists of: 
- My desktop PC which I use for **VMs, gaming, and recording videos**. 
- My TWO laptops which I use for **note-taking** and other activities on-the-go. 

My PC runs Windows 11 and I run **Arch** (btw) on my crumby Dell laptop and NixOS on my lovely **Thinkpad T450s**. 
- Dell runs [**chadwm**](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm) and [**siduck's st**](https://github.com/siduck/st) on Arch.
- Thinkpad runs NixOS w/ Qtile. Dotfiles can be found in the [**dotfiles** folder](https://github.com/nubbsterr/nubbsterr/) on my GitHub.

My current activities are:
* Grinding **HTB** Academy/Labs a bunch
* Posting lab attempts and Limbus Company videos on my [**YT**](https://www.youtube.com/@0xnubb)
* Working on my [**portfolio**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/web)
* Creating my own [**AV**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/Eurofighter) in Python
* Creating some tools, namely my own [**port scanner**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/sawyer) 

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
