I'm a **Grade 12 CS Student** with a passion for programming, robotics and cybersecurity!

The bulk of my time is spent at school, most of my time afterschool is spent working on **projects**, which you can always find on my **GitHub**! I am also doing some **homelab** setup which you can soon find on my GitHub, as well as a lot of Blue/Red Team studying for Active Directory particularly! 

My current activities are:
* Grinding **HTB** a bunch
* Working on my [**portfolio**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/web)
* Creating my own [**AV**](https://github.com/nubbsterr/Eurofighter) in Python
* Security+ review (soon)

I am always open to chat on Discord, so feel free to send me a DM @ nubbieeee :)
