NOTE! Only my waybar and kitty terminal work with Pywal at the moment, which is honestly fine by me. Wofi, dunst and Wlogout are not configured to work with Pywal which is whatev once again; waybar is all I need really in terms of that level of customization.

My NixOS config is outdated so don't use it; you can take the packages and other settings from it but do NOT copy over the NixOS version setting as that may brick stuff!

Some Arch packages to install ahead of using my setup (some are QoL and not strictly required!):

```
fastfetch waybar wofi hyprland hyprsunset hyprlock hyprpaper hypridle neovim xorg-xwayland wireplumber pipwire-pulse noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd mandb man-pages dunst unzip 7z
```

Some **AUR** packages to install:

```
python-pywal16 
```
